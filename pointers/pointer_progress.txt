Here are **10 pointer problems in C/C++**, arranged from **easy → hard**, covering fundamentals, memory management, arrays, functions, structures, and advanced concepts.

---

## 🟢 Easy Level

### 1️⃣ Basic Pointer Dereferencing

Declare an integer variable and a pointer to it.

* Assign a value to the integer.
* Print the value using the pointer.
* Print the address of the variable.

👉 Goal: Understand `*` and `&`.

---

### 2️⃣ Swap Two Numbers Using Pointers

Write a function that swaps two integers using pointers.

```c
void swap(int *a, int *b);
```

👉 Goal: Understand pass-by-reference using pointers.

---

### 3️⃣ Pointer and Array Basics

Given an integer array, print all elements using:

* Array indexing
* Pointer arithmetic

👉 Goal: Understand relationship between arrays and pointers.

---

## 🟡 Medium Level

### 4️⃣ Find Largest Element Using Pointer

Write a function that takes an array and its size using pointers and returns the largest element.

```c
int findMax(int *arr, int size);
```

👉 Goal: Practice pointer traversal.

---

### 5️⃣ Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamically allocate memory for `n` integers:

* Take input from user
* Store values
* Print them
* Free the memory

Use:

* `malloc` / `free` (C)
  OR
* `new` / `delete` (C++)

👉 Goal: Understand heap memory.

---

### 6️⃣ Reverse an Array Using Pointers

Reverse an array **in-place** using two pointers.

👉 Goal: Practice pointer manipulation.

---

## 🟠 Intermediate-Advanced

### 7️⃣ Pointer to Pointer

Write a program that:

* Declares an integer
* Uses a pointer to it
* Uses a pointer to that pointer
* Prints the value using double dereferencing

👉 Goal: Understand `int **ptr`.

---

### 8️⃣ Array of Pointers

Create an array of 5 strings using:

* `char *arr[5]` (C style)
  OR
* `std::string *arr[5]` (C++)

Print all strings using pointer notation.

👉 Goal: Understand array of pointers vs pointer to array.

---

## 🔴 Advanced Level

### 9️⃣ Dynamic 2D Array Using Double Pointer

Dynamically create a 2D array using pointers.

```c
int **matrix;
```

Allocate memory for rows and columns, assign values, print them, and free memory properly.

👉 Goal: Master double pointers and dynamic allocation.

---

### 🔟 Function Pointers

Create a calculator program using function pointers:

```c
int add(int, int);
int subtract(int, int);
int multiply(int, int);
```

Use a function pointer to select the operation.

👉 Goal: Understand pointers to functions.

---

# 🧠 Bonus (Very Hard – Interview Level)

### ⭐ Implement a Simple Linked List from Scratch

Using pointers:

* Create a node structure
* Insert at beginning
* Insert at end
* Delete a node
* Print the list

👉 Goal: Real-world pointer mastery.

If you'd like, I can also:

* Provide **solutions**
* Give **MCQ-style pointer trick questions**
* Or create a **pointer debugging challenge set**
* Or tailor them specifically for C vs C++ (since you're working with C/C++)
